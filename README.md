# OpenLRLens

A browser-based diagnostic decoder for [OpenLR](https://www.openlr-association.com/) location references. The Rust core compiles to WebAssembly and runs the full codec, graph, and A\* path search entirely client-side. A MapLibre GL JS front end renders the decoded path and step-by-step diagnostics.

Two decode formats are supported:

- **OpenLR binary v3** (TomTom) — 11.25° bearing buckets, ~58.6 m DNP buckets
- **TPEG-OLR / ISO 21219-22** — full-precision intervals

## Architecture

```
BUILD TIME  (a few times per year)
  Road network source data ──▶ pipeline/ ──▶ PMTiles archive ──▶ R2 / CDN

RUNTIME  (browser, no server)
  PMTiles (range reads) ──▶ TileLoader ──▶ OpenLRDataProvider ──▶ in-memory graph
                                                    │
  OpenLR string ──▶ codec (v3 / TPEG) ──▶ unified LRP model
                                                    │
                                  engine: candidate selection + A* + validation
                                                    │
                                         diagnostics + MapLibre UI
```

All map I/O stays in JavaScript. WASM receives pre-fetched tile bytes and operates synchronously over an in-memory cache, avoiding async-trait across the FFI boundary.

### Rust crates

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `openlr-codec` | v3 / TPEG-OLR binary parsing → unified `Lrp` model |
| `openlr-graph` | Tile format, segment/node tables, geometry pool |
| `openlr-engine` | Candidate selection, A\* (`state = (node, incoming_segment)`), scoring, diagnostics |
| `openlr-provider` | `OpenLRDataProvider` trait + `PmtilesProvider` implementation |
| `openlr-wasm` | `wasm-bindgen` glue exposing `decode` / `decode_forced` to JS |
| `pipeline` | One-shot CLI to build a PMTiles archive from Overture, OSM, or generic GeoJSONL source data |

### Web frontend

Vite + React + MapLibre GL JS + Zustand. Source lives in `web/`.

## Diagnostics

The UI is a stepped debugger, not just a result renderer:

- **Candidate panel** — per-LRP candidate table with bearing wedge, DNP band, and per-term scores. Each candidate shows whether it snapped to an interior point, start endpoint, or end endpoint.
- **A\* replay** — step-forward/backward through the search frontier.
- **Forced-decode mode** — pin any candidate per LRP and re-run A\* to see why the encoder's intended path was accepted or rejected.
- **LLM chat** — optional AI assistant with full access to the decode trace, candidate scores, and graph geometry. Bring your own key (OpenAI / Anthropic).

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain + `wasm-pack`
- Node.js ≥ 18

## Build

### 1. Compile the WASM module

```sh
cd crates/openlr-wasm
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../../web/src/wasm
```

### 2. Run the web dev server

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts both the Vite dev server (default `localhost:5173`) and a built-in tile server at `http://localhost:5176` (see the `tile-server` plugin in `vite.config.js`, which serves range requests out of `../out`) — no separate process needed. Override the tile source in the **Tile source** menu if you're pointing at a different archive or host.

### 3. Build a tile archive (optional — if you have road network data)

```sh
# NZ from a local PBF (~5 s)
cargo run --release --bin openlrlens-build -- \
  build --extent NZ --pbf new-zealand-latest.osm.pbf --output ./out/nz-osm

# Large region from PBF with low-memory DuckDB backend
cargo run \
  --release \
  --bin openlrlens-build -- \
  build \
  --extent world \
  --pbf out/europe-latest.osm.pbf \
  --output ./out/eur-osm \
  --low-memory \
  --progress \
  --compress-tiles \
  --duckdb-memory-mb 15000 \
  --duckdb-temp-dir ./tmp/

# Merge regional archives into one
cargo run --release --bin openlrlens-build -- \
  merge --output out/world/world.pmtiles out/nz-osm out/eur-osm
```

For local dev, drop the resulting `.pmtiles` file into `out/` and the built-in Vite tile server (step 2) picks it up automatically. For a deployed build, serve it from any PMTiles-compatible host (e.g. [`pmtiles serve`](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles), or R2/CDN with range-request support) and point the app at it.

## Tile format

Custom binary payload (magic `OLRL`, version 3). All integers little-endian, single zoom level (default z12). Segments are post-split at every interior junction — junctions are never elided. Each segment and node carries a provider-defined opaque stable ID (UTF-8 string, stored in a per-tile string pool). See `CLAUDE.md §4–5` for the full layout.

## License

Web frontend: MIT. Derived tile data license depends on the source data used to build it: OSM-derived sources (OSM directly, or any provider whose road-network theme is OSM-derived, e.g. Overture) carry **ODbL** — any served output must preserve attribution and honour share-alike obligations.
