//! Turns a concrete path on the road network into an OpenLR location
//! reference. This is the graph-algorithm half of encoding — physical
//! serialization (binary v3 / TPEG-OLR bit-packing) lives in
//! `openlr_codec::encoder`, which this crate's output feeds directly.
//!
//! Only Line and PointAlongLine locations are implemented (see the project's
//! agreed design). The other seven OpenLR location types either need no graph
//! algorithm at all (GeoCoordinate/Circle/Rectangle/Grid/Polygon are pure
//! coordinate validation) or reuse this crate's Line pipeline almost as-is
//! (ClosedLine, PoiWithAccessPoint) — left for later.
